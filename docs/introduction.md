# Introduction

Finding a common habit to work towards a goal can require a lot of unnecessary fine-tuning. Therefore, the goal of this document is to establish a common working foundation for maintaining, using, and developing Ansible in an organization with varying levels of knowledge.

We don't want to create a new blueprint on how to use Ansible, there are countless documents that provide a deep dive into the intricacies of Ansible. Those who feel called to do so should do just that!

But more than that, we want to create a basis that establishes a common language or pattern. Anyone looking at the Ansible content in our organization should feel enabled to work according to similar patterns based on existing examples and guidance.

Therefore, we will first give a brief descriptive introduction to the large Ansible landscape before moving on to practical examples, tutorials, style guides and tools.
